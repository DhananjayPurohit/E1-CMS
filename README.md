Things in the education system are quite disoriented and on a broader view chaotic when it comes to digitalization and at the end it is costly but it can be simplified by creating an open-source college website generator that solves most of the problems faced by them.

Some of the points:
A. Students will be able to track the syllabus of the college, the topic that is going in the college 
B. thread creation, open discussion, and segment creation. 
C. The system crawls the internet for resources that supplement the lecture topic such as open-source projects, book references and academic and/or professional papers. 
D. Anonymity must be maintained. A special portal must be created in order to maintain anonymity and also make them abide by a proper code of conduct that should not allow students to abuse or harass others.
